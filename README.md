# React and three.js

Trying use three.js to get a 3D model of Tāwhirimātea into our React and Redux website. 

There are multiple ways to get three.js into React. Here I use a react-three-renderer helper. It was effective and I got a 3d cube rendering on the website.

I got stuck tryign to get our 3D .fbx file rendering instead of the cube, and getting a background to load. I decided I needed a better understanding of THREE itself and reverted to rebuilding the site in vanilla JS and implementing THREE in there. This was successful: https://github.com/maddyking44/js-threejs-atua-website.

My aim is to come back to this next, and apply what I've learned in vanilla JS to getting THREE to work how I want it to in React.
