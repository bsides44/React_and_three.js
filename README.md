# User Stories

### Project-Wide

#### MVP:
* [x] I want this web app deployed to heroku
* [x] I want this to be open source
* [ ] I want this to be accessible
* [ ] I want this site to be mobile responsive

#### Stretch:
* [ ] I want to include original artwork in the site

### Home/Landing Page

#### MVP:
* [x] I want to see a landing page with a visualisation that changes depending on data received from a local weather API.
* [ ] I want the visualisation to live update
* [x] I want a title at the top of the landing page that reads the name of the project
* [x] I want to have a hidden nav bar that appears on the click of an icon.
* [x] I want to use the nav bar to explore more about the project: I can click on nav items and have those views render on the page.
* [ ] I want to see all the text in Te Reo Maori and English (hereafter referred to as bilingual)

#### Stretch:

* [ ] I want to see a sentence related to Tawhirimatea's current mood / the associated weather

### Thank You Page

#### MVP:
* [ ] I want a page with a list of people we wish to thank in the making of this project

### About/Kaupapa Page

#### MVP:
* [ ] I want an About page that explains what the ATUA_AR project is
* [ ] I want the scope of the project outlined here
* [ ] I want this page to be bilingual

### Translatable Text

* [ ] As a visitor, when I view any of our information pages I see the text in Te Reo Maori first.
* [ ] As a reader of this text, when I hover my mouse over any paragraph it transforms into translated english.
* [ ] As a reader of this text, when I hover over the next paragraph, the previous paragraph translates back into Maori.

* [ ] As a writer for the site, I have an ability to submit the Maori and English together, and know the translatable hover action will happen on the rendered page.
* [ ] As a writer, I have a clear understanding of which body of text will translate into which other body of text, so I have control of the translation.  In other words, the translation is not being done word by word but selected text by selected text with that selected text decided by the author.

#### Stretch:
* [ ] As a writer, I have a simple web interface to add new content and can decide it's title, the Maori, and the English.
* [ ] As a writer, I can decide the exact lines of text that are translated--so I can do sentence by sentence instead of paragraph by paragraph.

* [ ] I want a page where I can see how I can contribute to this project
* [ ] I want to see ways to contact the people involved
* [ ] I want a link to the source code/github repo
* [ ] I want this page to be bilingual  

### Process

#### MVP:
* [ ] I want a page that documents the story of the project itself
* [ ] I want to see images as well as text
* [ ] I want this page to be bilingual

## Our Data Model

Each text listed above is held in a database, and we can write new texts to push to that Db for a new page in the future.  

A text is structured as so:

### Option 1
_I will just use lorum ipsum, as we are not ready for actual text._
```
{"id": 1,
  "name": "Contributions",
  "title": {
    "tereo": "lorum ipsum",
    "english": "nietzsche ipsum"
  },
  "paragraphs": [
    {"sentences": [
      {
	"tereo": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa.",
	"english": "Inexpedient spirit derive truth value. Christian disgust inexpedient good overcome grandeur chaos free christianity mountains."
      },
      {
	"tereo": "Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem ",
	"english": "Morality ideal convictions intentions ubermensch endless eternal. Contradict grandeur zarathustra."
      },
      {
	"tereo": "Li Europan lingues es membres del sam familie. Lor separat.",
	"english": "Will victorious justice moral god. Eternal-return somesoem."
      }
    ]},
    {"sentences": [
      {
	"tereo": "Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariaturk.",
	"english": "Battle transvaluation christian will zarathustra chaos christianity pinnacle society will. Inexpedient value marvelous chaos will burying god philosophy superiority ultimate victorious."
      },
      {
	"tereo": "consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.",
	"english": "Decieve strong depths revaluation overcome evil convictions strong reason noble. Prejudice overcome faithful."
      },
      {
	"tereo": "iquasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam.",
	"english": "Hope overcome convictions revaluation overcome ideal chaos oneself ocean morality deceptions. Evil merciful ultimate ultimate joy."
      }
    ]}
  ]
}

```       
OPTION 2: Paragraph by Paragraph
**This will be the option we will work with.  The paragraph by paragraph makes both writing it up and reading it easier, based on the time we have and experience we want to make.

The key difference is that there is no longer a sentences array within the paragraphs array.  It's all just paragraphs.

_I will just use lorum ipsum, as we are not ready for actual text._
```
{"id": 1,
  "name": "Lorum Ipsum",
  "url": "lorum-ipsum"
  "title": {
    "tereo": "lorum ipsum",
    "english": "nietzsche ipsum"
  },
  "paragraphs": [
    {"tereo":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa."
      "english:"Inexpedient spirit derive truth value. Christian disgust inexpedient good overcome grandeur chaos free christianity mountains."
    }
  ]
}

```       
So in this case there would be paragraphs we can map over, each paragraph would be an object with a Te Reo and English counterpart that we could put into our <spans>

So upon form submission, the left-hand side would go into paragraphs.tereo and the right-hand side would go into paragraphs.english.  It would then be stringified and added to the DB.
